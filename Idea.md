# ApplyFlow

## Backend-Driven Job Application Management System

### 1. Problem Statement

Students apply to multiple jobs and internships across different platforms but struggle to track application status, interview rounds, follow-ups, and performance insights. Most rely on spreadsheets or notes without analytics or structure.

ApplyFlow aims to provide a centralized and structured system to manage and analyze job applications efficiently.
